# Virtual Doilies
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) for drawing Virtual Doilies.

## What is a Virtual Doily?
A Virtual Doily is a repeated pattern of mouse drawn graphics intended to resemble a lace doily. To achieve this, the drawing area is divided in to sectors radiating out from a central point. Any point drawn in any sector is also drawn at the same relative position in every other sector. In addition to this the points are reflected across each sector.

## Using the Application
To produce a Virtual Doily, simply click and drag the mouse - enabling you to draw on-screen. Through the interface you can adjust various attributes of the doily, such as:
* Pen colour
* Pen size
* Number of sectors
* Toggle sector line visibility
* Toggle reflection of drawn points across sectors
* Undo previously drawn points

The Virtual Doily can be saved to the gallery (capacity of 12) using the save button in the bottom right corner.
